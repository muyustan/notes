Based on the comment from @FarisAlsaad , the following worked for me and will hopefully work for other GUI users -- without the need to switch to 'user defined' configuration script.
Go to Debug Configurations -> Debugger tab -> Configuration Script -> Show generation options... -> Reset Mode ==> change to 'Software System Reset'.

seems the simplest way to deal with this is to just use

reset_config none separate
Then the reset is done internally over the SWD channel with no pins used.
